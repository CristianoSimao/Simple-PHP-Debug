# Simple-PHP-Debug
This project will create a simple code to show your PHP variables in a HTML black screen each time you reload your site page.
This code will combine PHP code and Javascript to easy and quickly make your site development easy.
<h2>Features:</h2>
- Show variables SESSION, GET and POST in a black screen all time you reload the page with the debug activated.

<h2>How to use:</h2>
1 - In the end of your PHP file include the "ui_debug.php" file, but make sure to place before the < / body > tag of your html output.<br>
2 - Then open your page in the browser passing the GET comand debug=ligado in the url. Example: www.exampleyoursitedomain.com/index.php?debug=ligado <br>
    The GET variable will be executed by the ui_debug code, creating a personalized javascript code that will be executed by the browser showing a popup window with the debug information and the classical black screen.<br>
